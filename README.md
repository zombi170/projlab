## Specification
In the Logarl√©c game, players control the students and play against the computer, which represents the teachers. 
The teachers' goal is simple: to prevent the students from finding the slide rule in time. 
They have several ways to hinder the students: they can take objects away from them, slowing them down, and they can even eliminate them from the game.

The students' task is more complex. 
They must navigate through the maze room by room, avoiding the teachers while also paying attention to the obstacles on the map. 
These obstacles might include room types such as a gas chamber, cursed room, one-way doors, or rooms merging and splitting. 
Additionally, the students have a limited time to find the slide rule.

However, they can be assisted by various dropped objects, which they can store in their bags and use at the right time.

The game ends and the teachers win if all players die or if the students fail to find the slide rule in time. 
The students can only win if they find the slide rule before the time runs out.
